Venly Connect SDK
===

Venly Connect is a javascript SDK specifically designed to perform common blockchain tasks. It is created as a way to perform tasks that are otherwise not possible due to security
implications (e.g: creating signatures). Venly Connect wraps all of Venly's functionalities within a JavaScript layer in order to facilitate development.
