# Introduction

> The Venly Web3 provider is a smart wrapper around the existing Web3 Ethereum JavaScript API.

If you already have an application running using web3 technology, you can make use of this wrapper to leverage the full potential of Venly Wallet API.
Your existing infrastructure is just one code block away from being **Venly Wallet Enabled**.

# Getting Started

## Adding the library
```bash
npm i @venly/web3-provider
```

Add the following script to the head of your page:

```html
<script src="/node_modules/@venly/web3-provider/dist/web3-provider.js"></script>
```

## Using the Library

After adding the javascript file to your page, a global *Venly* object is added to your window. This object is the gateway for creating the web3 wrapper and fully integrates [Venly Connect](https://docs.venly.io/widget/widget/introduction).

### Adding the web3 provider

```javascript
const options = {
  clientId: 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID',
  rpcUrl: 'https://kovan.infura.io/v3/YOUR-PROJECT-ID', //optional
  environment: 'staging', //optional, production by default  
  signMethod: 'POPUP', //optional, REDIRECT by default
  bearerTokenProvider: () => 'obtained_bearer_token' //optional, default undefined
};

Venly.createProviderEngine(options)
     .then(provider => {
         web3 = new Web3(provider);
     });
```

The web3 instance now works as if it was [injected by parity or metamask](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API). You can fetch your wallets or sign transactions and messages. 

If you provide your own implementation of `bearerTokenProvider`, the web3 provider will not attempt to obtain an authentication code, but rather use the one provided by you.

### Using Venly Connect natively

Although we use Venly Connect under the hood, the functionality of the web3 wrapper isn't limited to the web3 API. Linking or fetching profile information is not supported by Web3, but it is in our wrapper.
After creating a Venly Provider Engine, we add an instance of **VenlyConnect** to the global **Venly** object. As a result, it's possible to call Venly Connect natively, like so.

```
Venly.connect().linkWallets();
```

# Example Project
We've created two examples of the Web3 Provider in our demo application.

One only checks authentication and shows the login form after the user clicks a button:
* [Web3 Provider Demo](https://demo.arkane.network/pages/web3-provider)
* [Web3 Provider Demo html source](https://github.com/ArkaneNetwork/Arketype/blob/develop/pages/web3-provider.html)
* [Web3 Provider JS source](https://github.com/ArkaneNetwork/Arketype/blob/develop/assets/js/web3-provider.js)

The other checks if a user is logged in on page load. If not, it shows the login button, otherwise it fetches the users' wallets:
* [Web3 Provider (skip auth) Demo](https://demo.arkane.network/pages/web3-provider-skip-auth)
* [Web3 Provider (skip auth) Demo html source](https://github.com/ArkaneNetwork/Arketype/blob/develop/pages/web3-provider-skip-auth.html)
* [Web3 Provider (skip auth) JS source](https://github.com/ArkaneNetwork/Arketype/blob/develop/assets/js/web3-provider-skip-auth.js)
